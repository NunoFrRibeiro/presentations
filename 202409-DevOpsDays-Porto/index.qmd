  HOW?
  I will be showing how, in the process of building my personal web blog, i’m using Dagger to run: - Unit Tests - Linting - Building - Testing the server locally

  All locally before commiting the changes and let CI do it’s magic.

  WHAT?
  Although this is a simple web application, written in Golang we will be able to see how we can use Dagger, trace a parallel to more complex appications,
  and how we can benefit from Dagger advantages:
    - NO MORE YAML,
    - All CI code is written in Golang! Making it readable, easy to debug and also maintainable-
    - Locally show how to call Dagger functions to showcase some of the steps in a pipeline (be it unit testing, linting or building) 
    - Make a change to the code and show how Dagger caching makes it faster, first by failing and then by making it a sucess, - After Git push, see the run passing all the checks

  WHY?
  If it works on your machine it will work on CI.
